### About
"Where are you from?" It’s one of the first questions people ask when you meet them but it never failed to throw me for a loop. My stock answer was ‘I was born in Texas’ but it always felt dishonest seeing as I had lived everywhere but. I grew up in Germany, Belgium, and England and had the privilege of exploring many other parts of Europe when I lived abroad. I learned that people are people no matter where they’re from and that respect and kindness are universal languages. This is why I like exploring the mechanisms of our global society and trying to understand the successes and failures of economic and social systems to overcome the challenges of today.
